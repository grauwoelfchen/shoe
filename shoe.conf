# Virtual Hosts
#
# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#<IfDefine DEFAULT_VHOST>
# see bug #178966 why this is in here

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 10080

# Use name-based virtual hosting.
NameVirtualHost *:10080

# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
ServerAdmin yasu@localhost

# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
#
# If you change this to something that isn't under /var/www then suexec
# will no longer work.
DocumentRoot "/var/www"

# When virtual hosts are enabled, the main host defined in the default
# httpd.conf configuration will go away. We redefine it here so that it is
# still available.
#
# If you disable this vhost by removing -D DEFAULT_VHOST from
# /etc/conf.d/apache2, the first defined virtual host elsewhere will be
# the default.
#<VirtualHost *:10080>
#	ServerName localhost
#	Include /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/default_vhost.include
#
#	<IfModule mpm_peruser_module>
#		ServerEnvironment apache apache
#	</IfModule>
#</VirtualHost>
##</IfDefine>

## This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
#<Directory "/var/www/">
#	# Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
#	# or any combination of:
#	#   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
#	#
#	# Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
#	# doesn't give it to you.

#	# The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
